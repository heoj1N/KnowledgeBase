\section{Matrix Decompositions}
\subsection{Eigen-Decomposition (Diagonalization)}
For a square matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ (assuming it has $n$ independent eigenvectors), 
one can write:
\[
A \;=\; V \Lambda V^{-1},
\]
where $V$ is the matrix of eigenvectors and $\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues. 

\textbf{Symmetric matrices ($A = A^\top$):} 
If $A$ is real symmetric, then $A$ can be \emph{orthogonally diagonalized}:
\[
A = Q \Lambda Q^\top,
\]
where $Q$ is an orthogonal matrix ($Q^{-1} = Q^\top$). 
This arises frequently in covariance/correlation matrices in ML (PCA).

\subsection{Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)}
Any $m \times n$ matrix $M$ can be decomposed as
\[
M \;=\; U \Sigma V^\top,
\]
where
\begin{itemize}
    \item $U \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times m}$ is orthogonal (or unitary in complex case),
    \item $V \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ is orthogonal,
    \item $\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ is diagonal (in the sense that only the main diagonal may have nonzero values), 
          containing singular values $\sigma_1 \ge \sigma_2 \ge \cdots \ge 0$.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Usage in ML:}  
Low-rank approximations (truncating SVD) are used in PCA, collaborative filtering, 
and compression of large weight matrices in neural nets.

\subsection{QR Decomposition}
Any $m \times n$ matrix $M$ with full column rank ($n \le m$) can be factorized as
\[
M = Q R,
\]
where $Q$ is $m \times n$ with orthonormal columns, and $R$ is an $n \times n$ upper triangular matrix.

\textbf{Usage in ML:} 
QR decompositions often appear in least squares solutions, numerical optimization algorithms, 
and methods for solving linear systems stably.

\subsection{Cholesky Decomposition}
A symmetric positive definite matrix $A$ can be decomposed uniquely as
\[
A = L L^\top,
\]
where $L$ is a lower-triangular matrix with positive diagonal entries.

\textbf{Usage in ML:}  
Covariance matrices are often approximated via Cholesky for fast sampling (e.g.\ in Gaussian processes) 
or solving systems in Bayesian inference.
